# Mujoco Collaborative Sanding

This package provides a Python-only Mujoco simulation that recreates the collaborative robotic sanding workflow from the legacy CRS project without any ROS or hardware dependencies.  It offers:

- a lightweight UR-style 6-DOF arm model with a sanding tool
- tooling and fixtures approximating the original Gazebo scene
- parsing utilities for legacy CRS Cartesian toolpaths (YAML)
- damped-least-squares inverse kinematics for following toolpaths
- an executable demo that replays process paths with live Mujoco visualisation

The original C++/ROS2 sources remain untouched.  All new code lives in this `mujoco_crs` directory so you can iterate on the Mujoco stack independently.

## Quick Start

1. **Install/upgrade Mujoco Python package** – ensures the bindings and native libraries are available to the simulator.
   ```bash
   python3 -m pip install --upgrade mujoco
   ```
   (Optional) Grab the standalone tools from [mujoco.org](https://mujoco.org/) if you rely on the official `simulate` GUI.

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment** – keeps dependencies isolated from the rest of your system.
   ```bash
   cd /Users/pradeep/Downloads/Algorthimic\ HRI/Final_project_code/collaborative-robotic-sanding/mujoco_crs   # move into this package
   python3 -m venv .venv                                                                                     # create venv alongside the source
   source .venv/bin/activate                                                                                 # activate the venv
   pip install --upgrade pip                                                                                 # update packaging tools
   pip install -e .                                                                                          # install mujoco_crs in editable mode
   ```

3. **Run the demo** – launches Mujoco, generates a default rectangular toolpath, and plays it in the viewer.
   - **macOS with viewer:** the interactive viewer must run under MuJoCo’s `mjpython` interpreter.
     ```bash
     /Applications/MuJoCo.app/Contents/MacOS/mjpython -m mujoco_crs.run --viewer
     ```
   - **Other platforms / headless:** the standard entry point works as expected.
     ```bash
     mujoco-crs-demo --viewer     # Linux/Windows interactive
     mujoco-crs-demo              # headless on any platform
     ```
   The viewer opens with the arm already tracking a flat-panel sanding pattern.

4. **Use legacy CRS toolpaths**
   ```bash
   # macOS viewer
   /Applications/MuJoCo.app/Contents/MacOS/mjpython -m mujoco_crs.run \
     --toolpath /Users/pradeep/Downloads/Algorthimic\ HRI/Final_project_code/collaborative-robotic-sanding/crs_process_data/data/main/toolpaths/part_2/job_0_degrees_20200520T192241.997282.yaml \
     --viewer

   # Linux/Windows viewer (or any headless run)
   mujoco-crs-demo \
     --toolpath /Users/pradeep/Downloads/Algorthimic\ HRI/Final_project_code/collaborative-robotic-sanding/crs_process_data/data/main/toolpaths/part_2/job_0_degrees_20200520T192241.997282.yaml \
     --viewer
   ```

   Add `--part-config` to point at the matching `crs.yaml` if you want the original part placement.

See `docs/SETUP_GUIDE.md` for full installation notes and simulation workflow.
